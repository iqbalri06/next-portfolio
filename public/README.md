You need actual binary GLB and PNG files, not text files with comments.

For card.glb:
1. Download a sample ID card model from https://market.pmnd.rs/model/id-card
2. Or export a simple cube/card from Blender as GLB

For lanyard.png:
1. Create a simple striped pattern in any image editor
2. Save as PNG with transparency

Place these files directly in the public folder:
- /D:/next-portofolio/public/card.glb
- /D:/next-portofolio/public/lanyard.png
